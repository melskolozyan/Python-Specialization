'''In this assignment you will write a Python program similar to http://www.pythonlearn.com/code/urllink2.py. The
program will use urllib to read the HTML from the data files below, and parse the data, extracting numbers and compute
the sum of the numbers in the file. The file is a table of names and comment counts. You can ignore most of the data in
the file except for lines like the following:

<tr><td>Modu</td><td><span class="comments">90</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>Kenzie</td><td><span class="comments">88</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>Hubert</td><td><span class="comments">87</span></td></tr>
You are to find all the <span> tags in the file and pull out the numbers from the tag and sum the numbers.
Look at the sample code provided. It shows how to find all of a certain kind of tag, loop through the tags and extract
the various aspects of the tags.'''
