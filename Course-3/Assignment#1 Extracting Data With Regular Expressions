'''In this assignment you will read through and parse a file with text and numbers. You will extract all the numbers in
the file and compute the sum of the numbers. The basic outline of this problem is to read the file, look for integers
using the re.findall(), looking for a regular expression of '[0-9]+' and then converting the extracted strings to
integers and summing up the integers.

#Desired output
#445822

#Method 1   Here the program reads the whole file which may cause problems in case the specific file is too big in size
import re
fname = raw_input('Enter file name: ')
if len(fname) < 1: fname = 'regex_sum_42.txt'
fn = open(fname).read()
a = (re.findall('[0-9]+', fn))
for i in range(len(a)):
    a[i] = int(a[i])
print sum(a)
'''

#Method 2   Here the program creates a temporary integer list for every line and keeps the RAM more free
import re
sum = 0
fname = raw_input('Enter file name: ')
if len(fname) < 1: fname = 'regex_sum_42.txt'
fname = open(fname)
for line in fname:
    tlist = (re.findall('[0-9]+', line))
    for num in tlist:
        sum = sum + int(num)
print sum
