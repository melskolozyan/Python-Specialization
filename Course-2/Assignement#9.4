'''9.4 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out who has the sent the greatest number of mail
messages. The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the second word of those lines as the person who sent the mail.
The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail address to a count of the number of times they
appear in the file. After the dictionary is produced, the program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop to
find the most prolific committer.'''
