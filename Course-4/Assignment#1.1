Create a SQLITE database or use an existing database and create a table in the database called "Ages":

CREATE TABLE Ages (
  name VARCHAR(128),
  age INTEGER
)
Make sure the table is empty by deleting any rows that you previously inserted, and insert these rows and only
these rows with the following commands:

DELETE FROM Ages;
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Leia', 19);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Qandeel', 23);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Navneet', 14);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Fathma', 34);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Zaak', 22);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Ediomi', 23);

Once the inserts are done, run the following SQL command:

SELECT hex(name || age) AS X FROM Ages ORDER BY X' #this concatinates the srt and int and passes it to the hex function.

Find the first row in the resulting record set and enter the long string that looks like 53656C696E613333.
