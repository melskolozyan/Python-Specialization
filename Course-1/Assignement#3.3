3.3 Write a program to prompt the user for a score using raw_input. Print out a letter grade based on the following table:
Score Grade
>= 0.9 A
>= 0.8 B
>= 0.7 C
>= 0.6 D
< 0.6 F
If the user enters a value out of range, print a suitable error message and exit. For the test, enter a score of 0.85. 

# output:
#B

try:
    s = float(raw_input("Enter Score: "))
    if s > 1: print "Enter Score in Range"
    elif s >= 0.9: print "A"
    elif s >= 0.8: print "B"
    elif s >= 0.7: print "C"
    elif s >= 0.6: print "D"
    else: print "F"
except: print "Please enter a number"
